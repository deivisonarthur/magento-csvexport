# Magento CSV Export Extension

Extension that enables the generation of large CSV files.

With this extension you can generate and download huge csv files. Every time you need a updated csv you can go to the admin panel and trigger the cron. 
The cron is only executed when you say so, I mean, you say to the extension: I want a new updated csv! This behaviour avoids wasting of processing. (LetÂ´s save the environment!)
